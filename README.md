# Welcome my hiring test!

## Running the application

### To run the football-leagues application in you local machine you just need to:

 - Make sure you have MySQL and Java 8 installed in your local 
 
 - Import   the project in Intellj IDEA and if that's the first time you run the
   app run first the **liquibase:update** Maven goal that will
   automatically generate the data structure. Before running the goal
   and the application, remember add your database url and credentials
   to ***liquibase.properties*** and ***application.properties*** both
   located in *resources/config/* (DO NOT FORGET THIS).

Once you updated the properties files and **liquibase:update** already run the application is ready to go!

Run it and import data from football-data.org!
